Project Structure
1. Project Root
README.md (Explains the project, how to run it, and how to contribute if it's open-source)
requirements.txt (Lists all Python packages needed)

2. src/
Main Solver Script
main.py (Entry point for the application)
Cube Representation
cube.py (Class to represent the cube and its states)
Solver Algorithms
solver.py (Contains various solving algorithms like layer by layer, Fridrich method, etc.)
Move Definitions
moves.py (Defines the movements of the cube faces)
Utility Functions
utils.py (Helper functions, like rotation, pattern recognition, etc.)

3. tests/
test_cube.py (Tests for the cube representation)
test_solver.py (Tests for the solver algorithms)
test_moves.py (Tests for move definitions)

4. docs/
project_documentation.md (Detailed explanation of solving methods, cube operations, etc.)
api_docs/ (Auto-generated or manually written documentation for your classes and methods)

5. data/
patterns.json or patterns.csv (Predefined patterns or scenarios for testing or demonstration)

6. scripts/
run_solver.py (A script to easily run the solver with different parameters)


Workflow:
Initialize the Cube: Create an instance of the cube with some initial state.

Solve: Call the solver algorithm which, in turn, uses move definitions to manipulate the cube state until solved.

Output: Log or display the solution, possibly with statistics on moves, time, etc.

You can start by sketching out the interfaces for each component before diving into the actual implementation.
